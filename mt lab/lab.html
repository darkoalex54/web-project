    <h1 class="hello">About me  </h1>
    <p>My name is Darko Alex Ohene. A Computer Engineering student.
    So yes, my inspiration for picking the course is that I have great interest in computer software. And computer software is more of programming,in the sense of giving instructions to the computer system as to what it should do.
    Programming is one act I find great joy doing it. Computer Engineering is one course with widespread knowledge concerning all aspects of the computer and the computer world
    Gaining admission to KNUST was of great joy. I was granted the opportunity to come study computer engineering and this is one opportunity I've decided to take full advantage of it. <br>There are wonderful career opportunities in the field of computer engineering <br>
